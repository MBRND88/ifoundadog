# Contributing

Welcome to iFoundADog! We'd like to first and foremost thank you for your interest in the project. iFoundADog is a big project and wouldn't be as half as great without the help of kind contributors. There are just a few guidelines that we'd like everyone to try and stick too:
1. All feature requests and bugs should be documented in the [issue](https://github.com/cmhedrick/ifoundadog/issues) section of the repo.
2. When choosing an issue to work on, please only choose ones that have yet to be assigned or one marked as "Lingering". Unless you have verfied with the original asignee for a collaboration.
3. Branches of the main project should be titled in the format "<issue#>_<description>". Please use underscores to seperate words in titles.
4. When contributing work on python modules, please ensure the module follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Standards.
5. Stick to the standard conventions of the language you're working in.
6. If an issue hasn't been fixed within 2 Weeks, it will be considered "lingering" and will be up for reassignment. The assignment will be given a label marked "lingering", but the original assignee will remain on the issue till someone else picks up the issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure pull request titles are in the format "<issue#> <description>".
2. Always assign a reviewer! ALL Contributors should add [@cmhedrick](https://github.com/cmhedrick) as the reviewer if possible, if not another main contributor.
3. In the pull request, please be sure to include the issue number in the comment field. (if you type "#<number>", a drop down of issues to select from).
4. Once the assigned reviewer has reviewed the pull request, they should leave a comment on the pull request acknowledging the code has been reviewed.
5. After the reviewer has okayed and commented on the pull request, either the reviewer or requester can merge the pull request if able.
6. Alternatively, if a pull request is rejected, please make the requested changes and resubmit.
